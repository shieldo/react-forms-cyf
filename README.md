# CodeYourFuture React Week 3 - forms example

This code was written in a live session at a class for CodeYourFuture in Glasgow on 17th June 2023. It was done to explain an example of a controlled form in React, and in using a single form object to retain the state of the form.

It's relevant to [this page of the CYF syllabus](https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/react/week-3/further-reading/multiple-form-fields), which also contains a really good example of this pattern, with a slightly simpler means of handling changes to the form.

## Running the project

You can use `npm start` or `npm run dev` - either works :)
